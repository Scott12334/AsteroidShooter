This was a project I made to test the water with 3D game dev with Java. 

I created physics, audio, and collision systems to make this game run along with learn how 3D rendering works.

There are two games, regular and VR. At the time of creation I was trying to make a VR headset and this was going to be the first game for it. 
The only difference is that the VR will spawn two windows.
