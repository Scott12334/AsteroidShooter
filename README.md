Before I started using Unity, I was convinced it would be easier to make a game without an engine then with. Spoiler alert, it isnâ€™t. This was my first step into creating a 3D game and it was a lot. 
Developed using Java and the Processing library, it is a simple space shooter game where the player has to shoot asteroids before they reach the player. I created a collision system and used Processing to render the 3D objects. 
It was a lot of work but convinced me that I should take the time to learn how to use an engine. 

There are two games, regular and VR. At the time of creation I was trying to make a VR headset and this was going to be the first game for it. 
The only difference is that the VR will spawn two windows.
